# Get started
I recommend using IntelliJ, mainly because it helps a lot with auto imports and code completion.
But if you want to use Eclipse or another IDE you can do so.

### IntelliJ
1. Open IDEA, and import project.
2. Select your build.gradle file and have it import.
3. Run the following command: "gradlew genIntellijRuns" (./gradlew genIntellijRuns if you are on Mac/Linux)
4. Refresh the Gradle Project in IDEA if required.
